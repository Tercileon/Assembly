## Objectives

Upon completion of this topic, the student will have a fundemental understanding and be able to recognize the following common errors:

* **Syntax Error**
* **Run-Time Error**
* **Linker Error**
* **Logical Error**
* **Semantic Error**

---

## Introduction

There are several types of errors can occur while compiling our code in C Programming.  Recognizing these can errors when they happen can help us to code more efficiently and effectively.  An **error** is simply an illegal operation that was performed by the user that results in an abnormality of sort.  

As identified in the objectives the most common types of errors include:

* **Syntax Error**
* **Run-Time Error**
* **Linker Error**
* **Logical Error**
* **Semantic Error**

---

## Syntax Errors

The Syntax error is one of the most common error types.  It occurs when there is an error in a character or string incorrectly placed in a command or instruction that causes a failure in execution.  Basically, your code is just not written following the rules of C
 Syntax errors are detected at compile-time in C programming and will not allow your program to compile until resolved. 
 Examples of syntax errors include:

* **Missing curly-bracket or parenthesis**
* **Missing semi-colon**
* **Failing to declare a variable before using it**
* **Mis-spelling a function or variable**

Example of compile output:

`error: expected ';' before '}' token`

---

## Identifying Syntax Errors

Syntax errors can be identified easily.
A big indication is that the program never compiles.  That is usually due to a Syntax error.
GCC and IDE's with built in debuggers will be also produce information that indicate an error.

## Finding Syntax Errors

Syntax errors are not too difficult to locate.  Whether you compiled via terminal or IDE, you will generally recieve: 
* **The error** 
* **The problem** 
* **The code line number where error occured**

Exmaple of a missing semi-colon and the GCC output from this mistake 

yes_senpai@pop-os:~/CLionProjects/debugging_test$ gcc main.c 
main.c: In function ‘main’:
main.c:4:30: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘return’
     printf("Hello, World!\n")
                              ^
                              ;
     return 0;

As we can see here, the mistake is on line 4 character 30 in main.c (main.c:4:30):

`main.c:4:30: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘return’`


## Fixing Syntax Errors

Once the error has been identified and Syntax errors are often easy to fix. 
Simply replace or add to the syntax to correct the problem and then re-compile your code. 

**Note:** Often more thatn one error occurs when you initially compile your code.  Be sure to look for additional errors and correct those as well.

---

## Run-Time Errors

Run-Time errors occur during program execution, following a successful compilation. These types of errors are not easy to find. There are no messages pointing to the location from the compiler. 

**Example**

```
warning: division by zero [-Wdiv-by-zero]
    div = n/0;
```

## Identifying Run-Time Errors

Run-time errors may be a bit more difficult to find than Syntax Errors. Luckily for us, most compilers will produce a `warning` indicating where the problem is. 

---

## Finding Run-Time Errors

As noted previously, compilers will often produce a `warning` when there is a run-time error. This warning should contain a line and character at which the problem happened. 

For instance, if you divided by zero:

```
main.c: In function ‘main’:
main.c:4:14: warning: division by zero [-Wdiv-by-zero]
     int x = 4/0;
```
We can see that the error happened on line 4 and is the 14th character on that line.  inside of main.c. 

## Fixing Run-Time Errors

The first step with fixing run-time errors is to identify the warning.  Often times run-time errors may require us to change a bit more code than just one character or line. For instance, using the previous example, say it was `4/n` rather than `4/0`. If a loop had asigned `n` the value of 0 we would need to fix the condition of the loop or the statement itself. 

---

## Linker Errors

Linker errors occur when a required function or library could not be found. This occurs during the *linking stage* and will generally prevent an executable from being generated.  One common example of this is misspelling a name of a function when you declare, define or call it. 

`file.o(address): undefined reference to 'Foo(void')`

### Identifying Linker Errors

Linker errors are very easy to identify. In this case, the `warning implicit declaration of function 'foo'` should give us all of the information we need. 

```
Scanning dependencies of target debugging_test
[ 50%] Building C object CMakeFiles/debugging_test.dir/main.c.o
/home/yes_senpai/CLionProjects/debugging_test/main.c: In function ‘main’:
/home/yes_senpai/CLionProjects/debugging_test/main.c:8:5: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘foo’; did you mean ‘Foo’? [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
     foo();
     ^~~
     Foo
[100%] Linking C executable debugging_test
[100%] Built target debugging_test

Build finished
```
`no output on executable`

---

### Finding Linker Errors

If you reference the compiler warning above, the line and character number is provided above. This warning points to the `foo()` call in main. `foo()` was declared as `Foo()` above main (or in a header) with a capital H. 

### Fixing Linker Errors

In the case of the example; all the programmer has to do is fix the name. But this is generally all that has to be done in most cases. 

---

## Logical Errors

This type of error may not even seem like one at first. The program compiles and executes, sometime without any warnings. This error becomes apparent when an incorrect output is given. 

These are very common errors done by green programmers. Mixing up `==` with `=` or forgetting a semicolon are common examples. 

## Identifying Logical Errors

Logical errors are often not shown: while the compilers do not indicate an error.  The program compiles and there is virtually no indication other than an output that you were not expecting. 

The easiest way to identify this type of error is by setting up unit tests ahead of time and following principles of TDD. Otherwise, you will have to begin taking snapshots and debugging until you find the root cause/causes. 

## Finding Logical Errors

If a unit test was created, the unit test will fail. That will your red flag. 
else: (No unit test) You must take a snapshot and begin analyzing the information until you find an abnormality. 

Finally, you will have to begin stepping through the code with blocks setup. Followed by stepping back into your code until you find the root cause or causes. 

---

## Fixing Logical Errors

Once the code is identified, the programmer will generally have to change up the logic. 
**A few examples might be:** 
* **A variable was assigned rather than using the equal-to operator** 
* **Maybe the condition needs a `>=` rather than just a `==`** 
* **Perhaps the code is iterating the wrong direction. Etc** 

Fixing the error is as simple as fixing the logic. This will be a common occurance for a newer programmer. 

---

## Semantic Errors

These errors occur because the statements within the program are not meaningful to the compiler. The syntax used is correct, but maybe the programmer used the wrong variables, operations or order. 
For example; initializing a variable and trying to increment it without declaring the variable. Or doing something like `a + b = c`. 

## Identifying/Finding Semantic Errors

Semantic errors will be very similar to Logical Errors. Again, unit testing should make this error more easy to identify. Otherwise, you will have to find the abnormality and determine what the error is once you find it. Viewing variable values are a very useful way to identify this error. 

## Fixing Semantic Errors

Just like fixing logical errors, the programmer will have to fix their error in code by adjusting the order, operations or variables used. 

---

## Core Dump (Segmentation Fault)

Core Dumps are a type of Run-Time error. They occur when you access memory that does not belong to you. 
Example:  When a piece of code tries to do read/write operations in a read only location of memory. 
char x[5] = "Yall";
x[6] = 'l';

```
This will cause a `SIGARBT` which will dump the core. 
*** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated

Process finished with exit code 134 (interrupted by signal 6: SIGABRT)

```

But something like this may not even throw a segfault.... until it does. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char *buf = malloc(10);
    memset(buf, 'a', 10);
    printf("%s\n", buf);

    free(buf);

    memset(buf, 'b', 10);
    printf("%s\n", buf);
    return 0;
}
```

**If this didn't throw a segfault, why not?**

Well, even though we ran `free()`... that doesn't mean the OS took care of that action right away or even marked that it did (if in fact it did already free that memory). So it may not even know you are accessing freed memory... until it does. This "bug" may not even be noticeable at first. All may be working well. Until 1500 lines later... then it decides to throw a segfault. 

### Forgetting to Declare Variables

In C, every var must be declared for it's type. Many programers may forget to declare a variable. Especially if one is creating a for loop.
