# Lab1: Memory Access

1. Copy the Lab1 folder (and it's contents) to a location of your choosing. Remember, you do not want to modify anything inside of the repository folder you cloned from me. This way you can pull down future changes to the git repository if there is one. 
2. Modify the *.nasm file. This is the file you will be modifying throughout the ASM course. You may look at the other files if you wish (it is recommended). Each function should have a comment block - lines starting with ';' containing instructions. 
3. Build and run using the following commands:

```
cd ~/path/to/copied/folder/Lab1 
cmake . && cmake --build .
./lab1
```
